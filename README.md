# Student Management System – Spring Boot CRUD Application

## 📌 Project Summary
A backend-focused Spring Boot application designed to manage Student data using RESTful APIs. This project demonstrates industry-standard backend development practices including layered architecture, clean code structure, and database integration using Spring Data JPA.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- RESTful CRUD operations
- Clean layered architecture
- Spring Boot best practices
- JPA & Hibernate ORM integration
- Ready for extension into enterprise-level applications

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Framework:** Spring Boot  
- **ORM:** Spring Data JPA, Hibernate  
- **Build Tool:** Maven  
- **Database:** MySQL / H2  
- **Architecture:** MVC + Layered Architecture  

## 🧩 Application Architecture
- **Entity Layer:** Defines the Student domain model  
- **Repository Layer:** JPA-based data access abstraction  
- **Service Layer:** Business logic and validations  
- **Controller Layer:** REST API endpoints  
- **Web Controller:** UI routing and page handling
